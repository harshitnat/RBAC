# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

This is a custom Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built using Django. The system manages users, roles, and permissions, enabling access control to different parts of the application based on roles. The project implements the key principles of RBAC, including user management, role management, permission management, and access validation.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, and delete users.
- **Role Management**: Define and manage roles with associated permissions.
- **Permission Management**: Assign and manage permissions to roles.
- **Access Validation**: Check user access based on their role and permissions.
- **Audit Logging** (optional): Log access events and modifications (if enabled).
  
## Technologies

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (or PostgreSQL, depending on configuration)
